    "## Attributions\n",
    "Huge thanks to the folks at [Pallets Projects](https://palletsprojects.com). This CLI tool was built on top of [`click`](https://click.palletsprojects.com) and utilizes [`Jinja`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) as the default templating language. Both projects built and maintained by [Pallets](https://palletsprojects.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as natural language parsing, we utilize [`inflection`](https://pypi.org/project/inflection) for, well, text inflection. In short, we use `inflection` in places were we want to suggest or infer a change in the form of a word. Like, for example, if you specify that your model, say `Ox`, has a foreign key to another model, we will automatically populate the `related_name` attribute of your ForeignKeyField to be the pluralized form of the current model's name. In this case, `related_name='oxen'`. We also use `inflection` in many other places which, if we've done our job well, will be imperceptible to most of you. As of the current version of the CLI, this functionality is only supported in English.\n",

    "There's a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@oleoneto/what-ive-learned-from-writing-a-command-line-application-for-django-c08807ca6b67?source=friends_link&sk=79ef1b777c4c7411854010e0dda35052) up about why this CLI exists. Feel free to read it for context about why we think there's a need for it. But, in short, Ruby on Rails, the Django-equivalent web framework for the Ruby community is the motivation for why [`django-clite`](https://pypi.org/project/django-clite) exists. Seriously, go read the [post](https://medium.com/@oleoneto/what-ive-learned-from-writing-a-command-line-application-for-django-c08807ca6b67?source=friends_link&sk=79ef1b777c4c7411854010e0dda35052) for context.\n",
