    Push your project to your deployment server.

    This will prepare your project for deployment and run some checks for you. For example, the CLI will check if
    DEBUG or SECRET_KEY are properly configured. It will check if you have pending migrations and also collect
    staticfiles to your specified staticfiles location.

    First define your deployment upstream so the CLI can push your code to it. Once that is defined,
    in .config/upstream, the CLI will use the upstream server information to deploy your code.

    Supported deployment upstreams:
    - Dokku

    \b
        Define your upstream as DOKKU and add a DOKKU_HOST in your upstream configuration.
        The host needs to be an IP or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your upstream server.

    - Bitbucket, Github, and Gitlab

    \b
        Define your upstream as GIT and if your .git repository has an `origin` remote,
        the CLI will push your code to that server.

    Another thing this command seeks to accomplish is to bypass the need to navigate to
    the top of the directory in order to have access to the `manage.py` module. As long
    as the command is ran from within one of the following scopes, the command will work as intended:
