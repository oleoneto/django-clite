    Adds support for auto-discoverable commands/plugins

    Commands are auto-discovered if they are placed under the COMMAND_FOLDER.

    But please be sure to do the following for this to work:
      1. Name your package and click command the same.
      2. Place your command definition within your package's main.py module
      3. Any sub-commands of your command should be added to the top-most command in the package's main.py module.

      If you would like to skip a plugin/command from being auto-discovered,
      simply rename the package by either prepending or appending any number of underscores (_).
      Any code contained within the package will be ignored.
