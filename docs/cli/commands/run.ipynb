    "The CLI runner has a command that wraps Django's default `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands into a single `migrations` command. It combines both commands and runs them sequentially, as you may already do in your projects. It's just a neat little convenience command. Moreover, you can also specify which app you'd like to run migrations for, with the `--app` argument.\n",
